# Overview

## The challenge

Challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

# My Process

## Build with

-Semantic HTML5 markup
-CSS
-Flexbox
-BEM Methodology

## What I learned

At the beginning of the process, the most important consideration should be given to the structure of HTML. As I learned BEM methodology, I found these simple words useful to describe elements. Start with mobile design, then expand to tablet and desktop screens when a responsive design is needed.
